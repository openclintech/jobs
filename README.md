# Methodology
Due to the popularity of this question by students and colleagues, I put together a simple job board for inspiration/ideas, because job postings in these other industries are not intuitive in how they are named, but also for easy filtering & applying. They are all manually curated by myself every few days. In the future, depending on popularity, I'll plan to introduce some automated processes into deploying the job board.
